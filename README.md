TinyLink Project
TinyLink is a simple and efficient URL shortening application built using Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. Users can enter any long URL and generate a short, unique code automatically — or set their own custom code (like “iphone15”). It also validates URLs, prevents duplicate custom codes, and stores everything in the PostgreSQL database.
